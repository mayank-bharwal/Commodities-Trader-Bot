# EconoMystic: Commodity Trading Bot

This repository contains the source code for a Commodity Trading Bot, specifically designed to trade Gold Futures (CL=F). The bot utilizes a custom algorithm to make trading decisions and tracks its performance over time.

## Features

- **Real-time Tracking**: A continuous update mechanism for tracking trading decisions and returns.
- **Visualization**: An integrated visualization tool to graphically represent the trading bot's performance.

## Components

- `CommodityTrader`: A class that encapsulates the trading logic for commodities.
- `Visualizer`: A module to create graph data for visualizing the bot's performance.
- `Flask App`: A web application to display the trading data and graph.
